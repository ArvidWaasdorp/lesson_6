-----------------------

With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()
* A $ sign to define/access jQuery
* A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
* A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

Examples:
$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

jQuery uses CSS syntax to select elements. You will learn more about the selector syntax in the next chapter of this tutorial.


/**/
The jQuery library exposes its methods and properties via two properties of the window object called jQuery and $. $ is simply an alias for jQuery and it's often employed because it's shorter and faster to write.


/*Include JQuery to your page*/
Add the following script to you page. Preferrely add it as part of the header

<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google or Microsoft:
-------------
Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

/*Launching Code on Document Ready*/
To ensure that their code runs after the browser finishes loading the document, many JavaScript programmers wrap their code in an onload function:

window.onload = function() {
 
    alert( "welcome" );
 
};

Unfortunately, the code doesn't run until all images are finished downloading, including banner ads. To run code as soon as the document is ready to be manipulated, jQuery has a statement known as the ready event:
$( document ).ready(function() {
 
    // Your code here.
 
});

/*Create your own function*/

$(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});

Effects:
jQuery hide() : With jQuery, you can hide and show HTML elements with the hide() and show() methods:
$(selector).hide(speed,callback);
$(selector).show(speed,callback);

$("#hide").click(function(){
    $("p").hide();
});

$("#show").click(function(){
    $("p").show();
});

---------------
jQuery fadeIn() Method
The jQuery fadeIn() method is used to fade in a hidden element.

fadeIn()
fadeOut()
fadeToggle()
fadeTo()

$(selector).fadeIn(speed,callback);

$("button").click(function(){
    $("#div1").fadeIn();
    $("#div2").fadeIn("slow");
    $("#div3").fadeIn(3000);
});

--------------
jQuery Sliding Methods
With jQuery you can create a sliding effect on elements.

jQuery has the following slide methods:

slideDown()
slideUp()
slideToggle()

$(selector).slideDown(speed,callback);

$("#flip").click(function(){
    $("#panel").slideDown();
});

--------------
jQuery Animations - The animate() Method
The jQuery animate() method is used to create custom animations.

$("button").click(function(){
    $("div").animate({left: '250px'});
}); 

jQuery animate() - Manipulate Multiple Properties
$("button").click(function(){
    $("div").animate({
        left: '250px',
        opacity: '0.5',
        height: '150px',
        width: '150px'
    });
}); 

jQuery animate() - Using Relative Values
$("button").click(function(){
    $("div").animate({
        left: '250px',
        height: '+=150px',
        width: '+=150px'
    });
}); 

$("button").click(function(){
    var div = $("div");
    div.animate({height: '300px', opacity: '0.4'}, "slow");
    div.animate({width: '300px', opacity: '0.8'}, "slow");
    div.animate({height: '100px', opacity: '0.4'}, "slow");
    div.animate({width: '100px', opacity: '0.8'}, "slow");
}); 

----------------------
jQuery stop() Method
The jQuery stop() method is used to stop an animation or effect before it is finished.

The stop() method works for all jQuery effect functions, including sliding, fading and custom animations.

$(selector).stop(stopAll,goToEnd);
$("#stop").click(function(){
    $("#panel").stop();
});


----------------------
jQuery append() Method
The jQuery append() method inserts content AT THE END of the selected HTML elements.

$("p").append("Some appended text.");


jQuery prepend() Method
The jQuery prepend() method inserts content AT THE BEGINNING of the selected HTML elements.

$("p").prepend("Some prepended text.");

--
Add Several New Elements With append() and prepend()
In both examples above, we have only inserted some text/HTML at the beginning/end of the selected HTML elements.

However, both the append() and prepend() methods can take an infinite number of new elements as parameters. The new elements can be generated with text/HTML (like we have done in the examples above), with jQuery, or with JavaScript code and DOM elements.

In the following example, we create several new elements. The elements are created with text/HTML, jQuery, and JavaScript/DOM. Then we append the new elements to the text with the append() method (this would have worked for prepend() too) :

function appendText() {
    var txt1 = "<p>Text.</p>";               // Create element with HTML  
    var txt2 = $("<p></p>").text("Text.");   // Create with jQuery
    var txt3 = document.createElement("p");  // Create with DOM
    txt3.innerHTML = "Text.";
    $("body").append(txt1, txt2, txt3);      // Append the new elements 
}


------------------------
jQuery remove() Method
The jQuery remove() method removes the selected element(s) and its child elements

$("#div1").remove();


jQuery empty() Method
The jQuery empty() method removes the child elements of the selected element(s).

$("#div1").empty();


---

Filter the Elements to be Removed
The jQuery remove() method also accepts one parameter, which allows you to filter the elements to be removed.

The parameter can be any of the jQuery selector syntaxes.

The following example removes all <p> elements with class="test":  

$("p").remove(".test");
$("p").remove(".test, .demo");


=======================================
What is Traversing?
jQuery traversing, which means "move through", are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.

The image below illustrates a family tree. With jQuery traversing, you can easily move up (ancestors), down (descendants) and sideways (siblings) in the family tree, starting from the selected (current) element. This movement is called traversing - or moving through - the DOM.

The <div> element is the parent of <ul>, and an ancestor of everything inside of it
The <ul> element is the parent of both <li> elements, and a child of <div>
The left <li> element is the parent of <span>, child of <ul> and a descendant of <div>
The <span> element is a child of the left <li> and a descendant of <ul> and <div>
The two <li> elements are siblings (they share the same parent)
The right <li> element is the parent of <b>, child of <ul> and a descendant of <div>
The <b> element is a child of the right <li> and a descendant of <ul> and <div>
