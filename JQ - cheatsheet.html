With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()
* A $ sign to define/access jQuery
* A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
* A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

Examples:
$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

jQuery uses CSS syntax to select elements. You will learn more about the selector syntax in the next chapter of this tutorial.

The jQuery library exposes its methods and properties via two properties of the window object called jQuery and $. $ is simply an alias for jQuery and it's often employed because it's shorter and faster to write.


/*Include JQuery to your page*/
Add the following script to you page. Preferrely add it as part of the header

<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google or Microsoft:
-------------
Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

/*Launching Code on Document Ready*/
To ensure that their code runs after the browser finishes loading the document, many JavaScript programmers wrap their code in an onload function:

window.onload = function() {
 
    alert( "welcome" );
 
};

Unfortunately, the code doesn't run until all images are finished downloading, including banner ads. To run code as soon as the document is ready to be manipulated, jQuery has a statement known as the ready event:
$( document ).ready(function() {
 
    // Your code here.
 
});

/*Create your own function*/

$(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});
